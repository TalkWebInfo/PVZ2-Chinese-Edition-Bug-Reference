ZombieTalk: Exploring Bugs and Glitches in PVZ2 (Chinese Edition)

Welcome to ZombieTalk, a repository dedicated to documenting and analyzing bugs, glitches, and unintended mechanics in Plants vs. Zombies 2 (Chinese Edition). This repository aims to provide a detailed exploration of the game’s hidden mechanics and issues for educational and analytical purposes only.

Key Topics

1. Reproducing Previous Endless Zone Formations via Cloud Save Exploit

This exploit allows users to replicate formations from previous Endless Zone challenges using cloud saves. By manipulating save files across devices, players can restore prior setups, potentially gaining an unintended strategic advantage.

2. Multi-Accessory Buff Exploit for Apple Users

This exploit enables plants to receive buffs from multiple accessories simultaneously, bypassing the game’s intended restriction of one accessory per plant. The issue arises from managing multiple accounts under a single user ID.

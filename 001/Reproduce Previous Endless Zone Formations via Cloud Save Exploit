Reproduce Previous Endless Zone Formations via Cloud Save Exploit

This exploit allows players to restore their previous Endless Zone formations using the game’s cloud save feature. Here’s how to trigger it:

Steps to Trigger the Exploit:
1.	Start the game: Enter the game and play Endless Mode as usual. Plant the desired formation of plants on the field to counter zombie waves, and select the necessary plant card slots.
2.	Transfer the save: Use the in-game account binding feature (e.g., WeChat, Weibo, or Apple Account) to transfer the save to another device. Log in on the new device to load the save, then exit the game.
3.	Return to the original device: Transfer the save back to the original device. Reset the progress of the Endless Challenge on this device, play through the first level normally, and then force close the game using your device’s app manager.
4.	Reload the cloud save: Reopen the game and select the cloud save option. When you re-enter Endless Mode, the plant formations from the previous save will reappear on the field.

Additional Notes:
If the first step is performed during the final stages of the previous week’s Endless Challenge, and the remaining steps are completed just before the start of the new week’s Endless Challenge, the previous week’s formation can also be recreated.
